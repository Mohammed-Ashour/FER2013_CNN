# Face Exepression Recognition-Capstone

My capstone project for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree

**Topic:** 
FER2013 Model for Facial Exepression recognition
## Dataset

The training and testing datasets can be downloaded from [Kaggle's competition webpage](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data).

Note: The notebook assumes data files are stored in `./data/` directory.
